      The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is backtracking algorithm to find all maximal
      cliques in a graph. Each maximal clique can be listed in polynomial time.
      However, the maximum possible number of cliques is exponential, leading to
      an exponential complexity for enumeration of all maximal cliques. To
      overcome this, the paper by
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5440">David et. al.</a> showed that a
      parameterized variant of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, parameterized by
      degeneracy of a graph enumerates all maximal cliques in graphs of constant
      degeneracy in linear time w.r.t the number of vertices in the graph.

    <p class="experimentalText">
      The Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm was implemented on the following 3 datasets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="expList">
        <b>Enron Email Network:</b>
        <span
          >The
          <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.html"
            >Enron email network</a
          >
          dataset is an email communication dataset with around half a million
          emails. Nodes of the network are email addresses and if an address i
          sent at least one email to address j, the graph contains an undirected
          edge from i to j. This dataset has <b>36,692</b> nodes and
          <b>183,831</b> edges.

          dataset represents the connectivity of autonomous systems (AS) on the
          internet. Nodes of the network are ASes and if an AS i has a
          connection to AS j, the graph contains a directed edge from i to j.
          This dataset has <b>1,696,415</b> nodes and <b>11,095,298</b> edges.

          dataset captures votes from Wikipedia administrator elections. Nodes
